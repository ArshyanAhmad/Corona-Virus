                <p>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans
                    and
                    birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in
                    humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly
                    rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing the
                    ongoing pandemic. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and
                    encephalomyelitis.</p> <br> <br>

                <p> Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order
                    Nidovirales and realm Riboviria.[3][4] They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense
                    single-stranded
                    RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.[5] The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from
                    approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.[6] They have characteristic
                    club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image
                    reminiscent of the stellar corona, from which their name derives.[7]</p>

                <h2>♦ Etymology</h2>
                <p>The name "coronavirus" is derived from Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "wreath", itself a borrowing
                    from Greek κορώνη korṓnē, "garland, wreath".[8][9] The name was coined by June Almeida and David
                    Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses.[10] The word was first used in print in
                    1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of
                    viruses.[7] The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the
                    virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an
                    image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo.[7][10] This morphology is created by the viral spike
                    peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.[11] <br> <br>

                    The scientific name Coronavirus was accepted as a genus name by the International Committee for the
                    Nomenclature of Viruses (later renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) in 1971.[12]
                    As the number of new species increased, the genus was split into four genera, namely
                    Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus in 2009.[13] The common
                    name coronavirus is used to refer to any member of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae.[4] As of 2020,
                    45 species are officially recognised.[14] <br> <br></p>

                <h4>Microbiology</h4>
                <h2>♦ Structure</h2>
                <p>Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections.[43] Their size
                    is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm
                    in diameter.[44] The total molecular mass is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an envelope
                    embedded with a number of protein molecules.[45] The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and
                    nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.[46] <br> <br>

                    The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike
                    (S) structural proteins are anchored.[47] The molar ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is
                    approximately 1:20:300.[48] The E and M protein are the structural proteins that combined with the
                    lipid bilayer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size.[49] S proteins are needed for
                    interaction with the host cells. But human coronavirus NL63 is peculiar in that its M protein has
                    the binding site for the host cell, and not its S protein.[50] The diameter of the envelope is 85
                    nm. The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron-dense
                    shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the electron beam used to scan the virus
                    particle).[51][49] <br> <br>

                    The M protein is the main structural protein of the envelope that provides the overall shape and is
                    a type III membrane protein. It consists of 218 to 263 Amino acid residues and forms a layer 7.8 nm
                    thick.[45] It has three domains, a short N-terminal ectodomain, a triple-spanning transmembrane
                    domain, and a C-terminal endodomain. The C-terminal domain forms a matrix-like lattice that adds to
                    the extra-thickness of the envelope. Different species can have either N- or O-linked glycans in
                    their protein amino-terminal domain. The M protein is crucial during the assembly, budding, envelope
                    formation, and pathogenesis stages of the virus lifecycle.[52] <br> <br>

                    The E proteins are minor structural proteins and highly variable in different species.[44] There are
                    only about 20 copies of the E protein molecule in a coronavirus particle.[48] They are 8.4 to 12 kDa
                    in size and are composed of 76 to 109 amino acids.[44] They are integral proteins (i.e. embedded in
                    the lipid layer) and have two domains namely a transmembrane domain and an extramembrane C-terminal
                    domain. They are almost fully α-helical, with a single α-helical transmembrane domain, and form
                    pentameric (five-molecular) ion channels in the lipid bilayer. They are responsible for virion
                    assembly, intracellular trafficking and morphogenesis (budding).[45] <br> <br>

                <h2>♦ Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)</h2>
                    Diagram of the genome and functional domains of the S protein for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
                    The spikes are the most distinguishing feature of coronaviruses and are responsible for the corona-
                    or halo-like surface. On average a coronavirus particle has 74 surface spikes.[53] Each spike is
                    about 20 nm long and is composed of a trimer of the S protein. The S protein is in turn composed of
                    an S1 and S2 subunit. The homotrimeric S protein is a class I fusion protein which mediates the
                    receptor binding and membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. The S1 subunit forms the head
                    of the spike and has the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The S2 subunit forms the stem which anchors
                    the spike in the viral envelope and on protease activation enables fusion. The two subunits remain
                    noncovalently linked as they are exposed on the viral surface until they attach to the host cell
                    membrane.[45] In a functionally active state, three S1 are attached to two S2 subunits. The subunit
                    complex is split into individual subunits when the virus binds and fuses with the host cell under
                    the action of proteases such as cathepsin family and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of
                    the host cell.[54] <br> <br>


                    After binding of the ACE2 receptor, SARS-CoV spike is activated and cleaved at the S1/S2 level
                    S1 proteins are the most critical components in terms of infection. They are also the most variable
                    components as they are responsible for host cell specificity. They possess two major domains named
                    N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), both of which serve as the
                    receptor-binding domains. The NTDs recognize and bind sugars on the surface of the host cell. An
                    exception is the MHV NTD that binds to a protein receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell
                    adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). S1-CTDs are responsible for recognizing different protein receptors
                    such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4
                    (DPP4).[45] <br> <br>

                    A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also has a
                    shorter spike-like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).[42] The HE proteins occur as
                    homodimers composed of about 400 amino acid residues and are 40 to 50 kDa in size. They appear as
                    tiny surface projections of 5 to 7 nm long embedded in between the spikes. They help in the
                    attachment to and detachment from the host cell.[55] <br> <br>

                <h2>♦ Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) </h2>
                    Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the
                    nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome in a
                    continuous Beads-on-a-string type conformation.[49][56] N protein is a phosphoprotein of 43 to 50
                    kDa in size, and is divided into three conserved domains. The majority of the protein is made up of
                    domains 1 and 2, which are typically rich in arginines and lysines. Domain 3 has a short carboxy
                    terminal end and has a net negative charge due to excess of acidic over basic amino acid
                    residues.[44]</p>
